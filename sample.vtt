WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.599
Well,

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.730
for testing purposes. I was thinking I really I beat Mara.

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
And she has to leave early because she has to be. It used to hurt. Sorry. Oh, HR

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
Meetings instantly right after he said reschedule.

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.880
Right. Oh, Mr. Good, yeah. Yeah, well, but we check today and

6
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
Will great here's what we Will Arnett is returning. I think we will now.

7
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.430
Yes, OK.

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.500
I can hear you. Can you hear me. Yep.

9
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.880
So we don't get to see, well, but we'll get to see us. Yeah, that's kind of one sided there well

10
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.610
Sorry about that. My camera doesn't work.

11
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.520
Like we share. Sure.

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.200
Sure. That's what else

13
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.720
Will you expect anyone else from your side of joint just trying to get Italian we should wait for

14
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.240
Dominic so

15
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860
I think Melissa might have said she may be coming, but I don't know.

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.480
She's a poly campus.

17
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.480
Oh, OK.

18
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.750
OK. It's been a while since I've

19
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.670
So,

20
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.980
A couple minutes.

21
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.810
Thanks you.

22
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.630
Guys, hear me.

23
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
Okay, cool. I said shoes moronic only social

24
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.140
She's going to join us. Lee. Yeah.

25
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.360
Okay, no problem.

26
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.340
She was my one time I had a device that was like you know spamming people and I got all the love notes from YouTube on the weekend that are like, hi, by the way, we're shutting your device down

27
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.150
But we went to high school together. Oh yes, it

28
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.950
Kind of funny. She knows she went up my husband do like Roman

29
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.780
Go Red Mountain.

30
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:30.120
Okay, so maybe I'll get us started. We are gathered here today and what I'd like to do you to colleagues is kind of share with you what we've been doing. And the problem we've encountered. Does that make sense.

31
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.110
Does that seem like a good place to start. Yeah.

32
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.420
That was great, where I started. So, okay.

33
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:48.990
So, Mara, and I work on the human resources team and our organization within the knowledge enterprises pretty large. And we have lots of distributed people in different

34
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.850
Building several miles apart and that's probably something you guys are used to one thing you're not used to is we changed our name a lot

35
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:09.930
A lot. And so, or even just in fact that we're now knowledge enterprise not okay we we are just knowledge enterprise which sometimes you'll see abbreviated with ke

36
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:24.120
We have all sorts of fun slaying acronyms for Katie, but nonetheless, and so you'll hear us say the knowledge enterprise as you knowledge enterprise. I think a lot of us still say okay, it's hard not to. Okay.

37
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.250
So one of those challenges we run into is we do a lot of centralized communication from our team and

38
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:49.980
I created several calendars and email accounts Back in the day, but I think I'm still the owner for actually but that are used by a variety of different people. And so I'm one of those is

39
00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:02.880
A calendar called the overhead events calendar. And so, um, one thing that's nice about it is that it's it's universal and it operates like a person.

40
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:13.530
It's been set up for so long. We have an email account and a mailbox literally a mailbox. So we can send as so it's not just a public folder. It's actually a mailbox and we have a calendar.

41
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.440
For to be able to send as that and it's nice because

42
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:33.000
A variety of people use it. It's a great shared resource. And when we need to contact the enterprise, it's a better business process and in general standard scheduling administrative over site.

43
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:43.950
Outlook best practices is to have like resource scheduling manage those types of requests, because it's usually not good to have calendars tied to a person

44
00:04:44.580 --> 00:05:03.990
And a more relevant example of this is we had a member of the HR team send out to meeting recurrences for very critical HR related things for our managers to approve time and leave. It's kind of a big deal. And this employee.

45
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:27.330
Did not put an end date on the recurrence and send them from her personal calendar. Unfortunately, she is no longer with us and we do not have the ability to modify those or to end them. And the bigger issue is when I'm

46
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:46.080
Unfortunately, when there are modifications to the payroll calendar. It happens at least two or three times a year with three day weekends holidays scheduling things time and leave has to be approved earlier and it's something. Sure. No, um, you guys use task and new to

47
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.200
The product.

48
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.020
Do you use task to approve timely.

49
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.050
Or do you guys go directly into PeopleSoft to record your time into request leave

50
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.340
We typically go into people's will not using my ASU.

51
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:22.710
Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. There's another system that a lot of the university uses so okay anyway. So we have these Miss directed misinformed never expiring calendar occurrences on about 1000 people's calendars.

52
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:43.410
To give you some scope of this. So it's kind of a big deal. One, we would want it, we would still like to fix that. And at least get those to go away too so that I guess there's twofold request in this. The other thing we'd like to do is to be able

53
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.220
To send to have like a shared calendar from the HR department.

54
00:06:50.490 --> 00:07:02.220
Where, not only do we use it for, you know, pay period reminders of improving time but also for things like our employee recognition event coming up or our town hall meetings just to have other opportunities.

55
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:12.300
When we do HR related meetings to be able to send from the HR account because we have knowledge enterprise HR. We just need a calendar associated with that.

56
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.850
And that's where we are, or some sort of Calendaring resource.

57
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:35.220
So basically, yeah. So from you guys, we're trying to get a better understanding of what is available. What is not available. What are the roadblocks and really an understanding of how. Has anybody else do this.

58
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.960
This can be a unique problem. I wouldn't imagine. And so we kind of wanted to pick your brains about this this particular scenario.

59
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:54.150
Both what we're trying to do moving forward. And if there's any possibility of of doing something about all these rope calendar events that we have no ability to clean up anymore.

60
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.380
So please feel free to share

61
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.380
And let us know what you think here.

62
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.860
All right. Um, well.

63
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.380
For the need of a new calendar.

64
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.100
A shared calendar is something we could do.

65
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.380
That's typically we don't create user accounts.

66
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.860
If we can avoid it, especially if it's something that has a username password.

67
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.700
It's more of a security thing on our side. We don't like the idea of these rogue accounts and we don't know who

68
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:43.380
Is using them. Because if you're logging in with a username password of that account and there's no way for us to keep track and audit of who's using it or what's coming out of there.

69
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.910
But if it's a shared mailbox. We can probably get around that.

70
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.640
Will have to bring it up with our security team and we just make sure that's okay.

71
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.110
That would be something similar to the okay the events calendar.

72
00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.580
Thank you.

73
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.920
And as far as the rogue events. Unfortunately, there's not a real good way of

74
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:18.270
handling those somebody will have to log on to the mailbox of the user who sent the event and delete it from there. And really, that's sort of a user by user basis.

75
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:27.540
I mean, is there any. Is that a possibility or Legalism surrounding a reactivation of an unknown non existent employees account.

76
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:36.240
It depends on what the state of the mailbox is if it's a suspended mailbox, there's no problem with us logging into it manually.

77
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.720
Already been deleted and that creates problems because there's nothing to log into

78
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.380
And in that case, it's more

79
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.400
Having the recipients. Remove the messages themselves.

80
00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:03.780
Right, which is not desirable, obviously I'm is OK, you guys have to know the account. The user name of the account or the name. So this car is right. Oh, yes.

81
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.280
Okay, yes, you're right. I mean, you probably have them on your calendar.

82
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.100
So it depends on when you come over for designers are still on task. Yeah.

83
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:22.950
Yeah, I don't know. I don't even trying to figure out how to do this. Well, I'm quick to delete things that I know don't make any sense.

84
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.900
I personally anyways. Long story short, love me, you don't have

85
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.140
To say Cooper. Yeah, it's healthy. I J K L M EC UVA

86
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:47.400
So I don't know if you guys heard that. But would you guys be able to look into that as you ID J o se si UVA and see if that account is suspended or expelled, can we remove

87
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.280
The idea again, yo.

88
00:10:50.820 --> 00:11:03.150
Yo se see you be a okay this sort of occurred in July, July 8 or beginning of July. Yeah, first, second week of July.

89
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.730
If that also

90
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.530
So particular user their exchange account is still active. It's only what suspended, but it still exists.

91
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.220
The job.

92
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:30.540
Which means it's a possibility to remove a day. So what would be the procedure. I mean, can we for to be an example of the event that we're there's two events that were referring to and see if he could coordinate with that or I wouldn't be that

93
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.800
So this will be a thing of Dominic would Dominic's team and probably take care of and most likely a support ticket.

94
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.730
Okay.

95
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:44.970
And just make sure you include you know details about the meeting that you want removed and the owner of the mailbox.

96
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.590
Okay, you want just a general email a

97
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.710
Either or we just really need like the title of the event so like the subject.

98
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.540
Is the organizer and then we can take care

99
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.690
Okay, and then

100
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.770
Would you recommend just doing a full delete or would you recommend ending this series on the next coming requested date and then

101
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:24.090
Ideally, if you just end the recurrence that would be the least disruptive to business, right, because if you just hit delete the series. It takes everything out.

102
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:33.210
Of course, I don't know. That's probably better. Okay, that's better. I would say, so we just have to articulate to them what our expectations are correct.

103
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.710
Yes.

104
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:42.390
Yeah, yeah. I mean, we can remove it completely, or we can change the date I believe

105
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:49.440
It would be easier for you to just go in and hit the Delete button. So I think we'll probably request that

106
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.600
Yeah, and delete the series, not the occurrence delete the series.

107
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.310
Yeah.

108
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.350
Okay.

109
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:13.770
And then as far as the calendar goes, we already have the knowledge enterprise Human Resources mailbox. We agree, we don't want the responsibility of creating an account with a login and password if there is a way to

110
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:28.260
Build a calendar for the already established knowledge enterprise Human Resources account that's definitely the way to go. We already have a permissions in a user's group associated with the access to that mailbox. So if you

111
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:35.580
Are a public folder, it's, it's a public folder. It's not an actual email account. So it's just

112
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.790
So there's a calendar and there's the public folder that has a look at a chart view and under that there's a calendar with the same name.

113
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:58.500
The problem we run into is when you guys create an event on that calendar that's there. You can't send as right okay HRT as you got edu. They don't want knowledge enterprise human resources.

114
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.360
That you would be open to investigating that correct with your security team.

115
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.250
It's a possibility requirements is on that.

116
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.830
Calendar needs to be able to process or one of so if your requirement is the calendar needs to be able to process incoming event requests.

117
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.000
Like if someone's gonna be sending invite to the calendar.

118
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.260
It's only an outgoing

119
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:33.480
We don't want people to invite to it. We want to be able to send as and then ideally monitor responses accepts the claims are tentative

120
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.730
Okay.

121
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:54.210
So if you could investigate the feasibility of that it doesn't need to be able to accept a request, it's a it's a one way calendar. Right. No one will ever need to send it a request.

122
00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:04.380
So you guys have. So for this existing calendar. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but if we if we didn't move forward on this. It sounds to me like it wouldn't have to be a brand new calendar right

123
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:11.400
Yeah, if we did create the shared mailbox. It'd be a brand new everything. Yeah.

124
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.630
So that's also something to consider is that this cannot be the calendar. You have now, that's fine. So let me okay if we kind of

125
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:29.640
Yeah, there's no, there's nothing on it is the calendar that was created. Is that what we use with. Yeah, it doesn't function the way we. Okay, great. You can have nothing in it. Yeah, okay. Most

126
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:40.650
Of the events account is actually an exchange. Oh, and it's not a bit. Yeah. So it's an event. Okay.

127
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:49.680
Ad Exchange today issue.edu so the events calendar, the events account lives that way. I don't know if it would be possible. Like, I would imagine.

128
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:58.140
It would be, it wouldn't be a problem, theoretically, if it was approved to create this account create the calendar. But in terms of like

129
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:08.280
Yeah, accessing the responses. I can only imagine forwarding that data. Everything that's coming in the mailbox to get live so like folder.

130
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:19.890
Doesn't matter where it lives now because it won't live there. Right. But like an event account. It actually is an account that gets mounted to all of the users mailboxes or so all of them live in there. Okay. Actually, you

131
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:35.850
To connect so like we can send as events and then all of the meeting responses go okay right okay but it's just, yeah. It just basically becomes person. Right. I mean, it is a person. A person. It's a big person.

132
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:51.660
With the permissions dictated by the users group which you guys control. Yeah. So currently about. One is we can't add anybody to that to people would have access to have access to it. We can everyone according to YouTube.

133
00:16:53.430 --> 00:17:05.520
Because it's not it's individuals. It's not a deal words to that. So I don't know. So for this one, we will give you the DL. Yeah. For this for this request for you to have the DL have permission to it.

134
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.560
Is it possible to have a deal have permissions on account like that.

135
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.460
Can you define permissions.

136
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.400
Well, let's just send us. Yeah.

137
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.620
Okay, the events email right now and I

138
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.690
Thought okay data issue.edu or it's like a million different redirects but exchanged. I know right now.

139
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:45.360
So, Brenda has access to that I own it, you own it. We were trying to get Brandon added to it and I was told no explicitly by you to that they can't add more users to it because the way it was set up before

140
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:52.890
So can we add a distribution list to add people to so we don't have to

141
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:01.920
It's easier to make conference rooms and stuff usually have distribution list that have permissions. Right. Yes. My understanding,

142
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:09.060
Okay. The reason you probably told no is because of again the security aspect of it.

143
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.960
Agree. We'll have to take a look and see what we can do.

144
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:24.780
Good. The calendar. We set up like a room or your conference room or something because those when something well because you don't send us those

145
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.780
We need to be able to send as

146
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.800
That's the critical piece you're having a public calendar that doesn't belong to anybody in the event of this awkward term.

147
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:51.030
Or someone leaves or I only appointment, but I'm on vacation and no one can I mean other than like everybody in the office, giving everybody access to their calendars. That's, that's not a good solution either like it just seems having a

148
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:58.230
Departmental calendar exists, like that. So if I send the invitation for my next workshop or new employee orientation.

149
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:08.610
And I'm out on vacation. Mara can be like, Oh no, there was a flood of this conference room. These things have happened to us. People we can't use that conference room, LAURA'S OUT. I'm going to fix this for her and she can't

150
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:17.730
Because it's time to my calendar or in this terrible situation we have people missing their payroll deadlines, because they have a recurring appointment.

151
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:28.020
That is tied to a person's calendar which is like awful. This is an HR nightmare. It's just awkward and just awkward. Oh my gosh. Is that awkward, so

152
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.510
Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you. Dominic. Yep, what, let me before we adjourn.

153
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:45.060
will definitely be sending the one request about how will handle that, or the recurrence of those two conferences or meetings, but

154
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:54.000
Will you guys want will you be taking the initiative for an investigating that, if we can create this other account for how do you guys want to go about that.

155
00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.660
I'm will look into it. We don't need a ticket or anything on that.

156
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.130
And then we'll get back to you on two seconds.

157
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:15.600
And you guys. You guys have a sense of like a time timeline of when we should expect a response or when we should follow up with you guys execute on here.

158
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.410
In the business Thursday. Should we

159
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:25.590
go that fast. That's awesome. Is there any details or additional information. You guys need from us.

160
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.950
I don't think so. Okay.

161
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.340
Certainly, feel free to reach out if there's anything

162
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.970
You guys have any other questions.

163
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:46.500
I think to be proactive. We will go ahead and make sure to share with you the email address that we already have the knowledge enterprise today shoot it to you as well as our department deal

164
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.160
In case you're just like, oh, here we can just do this. That way you'll have everything set up for the permissions and you won't have to ask us, that would make your life a little bit easier.

165
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.150
Sounds good.

166
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.470
Alrighty, thank you guys give our best stimulus. I'm sorry, Mr.

167
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.530
Whenever you submit that ticket for the one events through my name in there and the student workers should a bug me about it. So,

168
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.900
Thank you.

169
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.360
Guys.
